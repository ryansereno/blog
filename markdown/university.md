# How to go to University üéì

University is a major financial undertaking and often has poor returns.

These are my set of guidelines I wish I could share with my younger self:

## Study a CORE formal body of knowledge.

These are the *hard* sciences, engineering/mathematics, law, or economics.

Even if one of these isn't your *exact* interest, one of them can almost certainly be applied to your desired specialty.

If a science has ‚Äúscience‚Äù in the name, it‚Äôs probably not a real science, ie climate science, social science, etc.
Anything else (art and humanities) can be learned for free, outside of school.

## Choose a school based on cost and objective quality of education over prestige.

The era of respected ivy-league institutions is coming to pass.
Most community colleges and state schools are sufficient.
Commute if possible.

## Avoid private loans as much as possible.

Apply for EVERY subsidy and scholarship that is available to you.

Stay in-state if there are discounts for residents.

## Don‚Äôt just ‚Äúgo to class‚Äù.

During your time in school, explore a wide variety of disciplines and careers, both through learning and DOING.

Jobs hire based on *experience,* not education.
Write articles, start an organization, build prototypes, research independently.

Don't *only* rely on school organized internships.

Reach out to companies/ organizations yourself.
Ask questions, offer assistance in any capacity you can.
Pave your own path; it's essential to a successful life, and school cannot provide this skill.

## Don‚Äôt let your education end with school.

80% of graduates don't work in the area they studied.
Success and fulfillment come from life long learning.
School, especially undergrad, provides only a basic understanding of your chosen field; true expertise comes from a perpetual commitment to your discipline.
