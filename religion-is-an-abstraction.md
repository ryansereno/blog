# Religion is an Abstraction ‚úù

Date: January 17, 2024

In software, there is the concept of abstraction.
Low level abstraction is closer to the actual electrical activity of the semiconductors.

Machine language is the lowest level of abstraction a programmer can get.

As you go up in levels of abstraction, the connection to physical reality is lost, but ease of human understanding is gained.

Abstracted programming languages use actual english words.

Religion serves a similar purpose.

Religious abstraction seeks to provide a human-readable framework for understanding the divine.

At the base is God, the Dao, the Source, Consciousness, the Holy Spirit.

Then levels of abstraction are built upon it.

Similar to the C languages in software, there are low level abstraction religions- Zen, Daoism, Non-duality, etc.

Then, similar to Python in software, there are high level abstractions that allow more people to access and understand the underlying mechanisms- Christianity, Islam, etc.

They all seek to interact and connect with the same base system, but they can provide varying degrees of 'readability' to each person based upon their needs.
